# Netflix-Movies-and-Tv-shows-Clustering-by-Omkar

This project is aimed at conducting an in-depth analysis of Netflix's extensive catalog of movies and TV shows, sourced from the third-party search engine Flixable. The primary objective is to group these titles into meaningful clusters, which serves the purpose of enhancing user engagement and reducing subscriber turnover for Netflixâ€”a prominent online streaming service with a massive subscriber base of over 220 million users by the second quarter of 2022.
